FAT32 FILE SYSTEM

Sometimes a bunch of hidden sectors

Sector 0 won't contain boot info, rather a small amount of data (mostly HIDDEN SECTORS)

If Sector 0 doesn't look proper, look for HIDDEN SECTOR number

If found, advance Sector 0 Vector by that amount (on my cards it was 8192)

This will contain boot record. Go from here (as if it's 0)

All sector counts are +8192 afterwards. Guess this was happening all along and I didn't realize it
